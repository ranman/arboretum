		<p>Plants have developed many strategies over generations, in even the harshest of conditions, to ensure their survival and the survival of their seeds. They have developed amazing and fascinating defenses against even the biggest and deadliest of threats. Note that most all of these strategies are harmless to birds, since birds are great at eating seeds and pooping them out somewhere else, increasing the chance that the next generations of the plants will live on.
		<p>Pick a threat to a plant or have the computer pick one for you, then see which strategies of defense would work to save you from death ... and which would not.
